This module models fuel use with part load heat rate curves (AKA Input/Output
curves, AKA Incremental Heat Rate), and provides best-effort defaults when
detailed heat rate data is unavailable. It has a prerequisite of
switch_model.generators.core.commit.operate

This module can accept data in two formats: 
1) Part load heat rates that are a series of points: capacity_factor, heat_rate
2) Incremental heat rate tables as described in "THE USE OF HEAT RATES IN
PRODUCTION COST MODELING AND MARKET MODELING" (1998, California Energy
Commission staff report)
https://listserver.energy.ca.gov/papers/98-04-07_HEATRATE.PDF

However it comes in, the data is converted into one or more line segments per
generator, and fuel use is constrained to be above all of the lines. This
works well since heat rate curves for thermal power plants tend to either be
linear (single line segment) or concave up. If you need to model heat rate 
curves that are concave down or non-convex, you will need to write a 
new module to constrain the fuel use, likely using integer variables or
non-linear programming.

If you haven't worked with incremental heat rates before, you may want
to start by reading a background document on incremental heat rates such
as: https://listserver.energy.ca.gov/papers/98-04-07_HEATRATE.PDF

Incremental heat rates are a way of approximating an "input-output
curve" (heat input vs electricity output) with a series of line
segments. These curves are typically drawn with electricity output on
the x-axis (Power, MW) and fuel use rates on the y-axis (MMBTU/h). These
curves are drawn from the minimum to maximum power output levels for a
given generator, and most thermal generators cannot run at 0 output. The slope
of each line segment is the incremental heat rate at that point in units of
MMBTU/MWh.

There are two basic ways to model a piecewise linear relationship like
this in linear programming. The first approach (which we don't use in
this module) is to divide the energy production variable into several
subvariables (one for each line segment), and put an upper bound on each
subvariable so that it can't exceed the width of the segment. The total
energy production is the sum of the sub-variables, and the total fuel
consumption is: Fuel = line0_intercept + E0*incremental_heat_rate0 +
E1*incremental_heat_rate1 + ... As long as each incremental_heat_rate is
larger than the one before it, then the optimization will ensure that E1
remains at 0 until E0 is at its upper limit, which ensures consistent
results. This tiered decision method is used in the fuel_markets module,
but is not used here.

This module uses the second approach which is to make FuelUse into a
decision variable that must be greater than or equal to each of the
lines. As long as fuel has a cost associated with it, a cost minimizing
optimization will push the fuel use down till it touchs a line segments.
This method also requires that incremental heat rates increase with
energy production so that the lines collectively form a convex boundary
for fuel use.

    where the y-intercept is in units of MMBTU/(hr * MW-capacity) and
    slope is incremental heat rate in units of MMBTU / MWh-energy. We
    normalize the y-intercept by capacity so that we can scale it to
    arbitrary sizes of generation, or stacks of individual generation
    units. This code can be used in conjunction with discrete unit sizes
    but it not dependent on that. This set is optional, and will default to

    Import a fuel use curve to describe fuel use under partial loading

    Plants that lack detailed data will default to a single line segment with
    a y-intercept of 0 and a slope equal to the full load head rate. This
    default tends to underestimate fuel use steam turbines or combined cycle
    plants under partial loading conditions, which generally have y-intercepts
    above 0.

    We support two ways of specifying a fuel use curve as a series of line
    segments. Both files are optional; you may specify either one, but not
    both. In both cases, data is converted into FUEL_USE_SEGMENTS_FOR_GEN

    gen_loading_level describes the fractional loading level (0 to 1).
    gen_heat_rate_at_loading_level describes the heat rate at the given
    loading level in units of MMBTU/MWh.

    In gen_inc_heat_rates.csv, the first record is the first point on the
    curve, but all subsequent records are slopes and x-domain for each line
    segment. For a given generation technology or project, the relevant data
    should be formatted like so:

    mid_load1         max_load    slope       .

    The first row provides the first point on the input/output curve.
    Literal dots should be included to indicate blanks.
    The column fuel_use_rate is in units of MMBTU/h.
    Subsequent rows provide the domain and slope of each line segement.
    The column ihr indicates incremental heat rate in MMBTU/MWh.
    Any number of line segments will be accepted.
