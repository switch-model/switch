"""
Defines a simple hydro electric model that ensures minimum and average
water dispatch levels that can vary by timepoint. Most people use this
as a starting point for working with hydro because it's simple, fairly
reasonable, and easy to work with. This supports dispatchable resevoir-
based hydro plants. This module is not needed to support run-of-river
plants; those may be specified as variable renewable plants with exogenous
energy availability. This module is generally sufficient for day-to-day
operations where reservoir volume levels are not a binding constraint, but
does not track seasonal planning for fluctuations in reservoir volume.

A more full-featured hydro model is available in the hydro_system module from
the Operations, Control and Markets laboratory at Pontificia Universidad
CatÃ³lica de Chile. Where possible, I have used the same set and variable names
to aid interoperability. The Chilean module has a hydro model that includes
water networks that connect dams via waterways and ground infiltration. It
should be possible to describe a simple system using the advanced framework,
but the advanced framework would take longer to read and understand. To really
take advantage of it, you'll also need more data than we usually have
available.

# ToDo: Refactor this code to move the core components into a
# switch_model.hydro.core module, the simplest components into
# switch_model.hydro.simple, and the advanced components into
# switch_model.hydro.water_network. That should set a good example
# for other people who want to do other custom handling of hydro.

    HYDRO_GENS is the set of dispatchable hydro projects. This is a subset of
    GENERATION_PROJECTS, and is determined by the inputs file
    hydro_timeseries.csv.

    HYDRO_GEN_TS is the set of Hydro projects and timeseries for which
    minimum and average flow are specified.

    HYDRO_GEN_TPS is the set of Hydro projects and available
    dispatch points. This is a filtered version of GEN_TPS that
    only includes hydro projects.

    hydro_min_flow_mw[(g, ts) in HYDRO_GEN_TS] is a parameter that
    determines minimum flow levels, specified in units of MW dispatch.

    hydro_avg_flow_mw[(g, ts) in HYDRO_GEN_TS] is a parameter that
    determines average flow levels, specified in units of MW dispatch.

    Enforce_Hydro_Min_Flow[(g, t) in HYDRO_GEN_TPS] is a
    constraint that enforces minimum flow levels for each timepoint.

    SpillHydro[(g, t) in HYDRO_GEN_TPS] is an variable describing the amount
    of potential hydro power sent over the spillway (as opposed to being used
    to generate electricity). In high-flow or flood conditions, this can
    mitigate infeasibilities where the incoming flow is greater than the
    generator's capacity. It is specified in units of MW.

    Enforce_Hydro_Avg_Flow[(g, ts) in HYDRO_NONPUMPED_GEN_TS] is a constraint
    that enforces average flow levels across each timeseries. It requires the
    average of dispatched and spilled hydro over the course of a timeseries
    must equal to the corresponding hydro_avg_flow_mw parameter.
