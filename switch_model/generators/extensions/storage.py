    STORAGE_GENS is the subset of projects that can provide energy storage.

    STORAGE_GEN_BLD_YRS is the subset of GEN_BLD_YRS, restricted
    to storage projects.

    gen_storage_efficiency[STORAGE_GENS] describes the round trip
    efficiency of a storage technology. A storage technology that is 75
    percent efficient would have a storage_efficiency of .75. If 1 MWh
    was stored in such a storage project, 750 kWh would be available for
    extraction later. Internal leakage or energy dissipation of storage
    technologies is assumed to be neglible, which is consistent with
    short-duration storage technologies currently on the market which
    tend to consume stored power within 1 day. If a given storage
    technology has significant internal discharge when it stores power
    for extended time perios, then those behaviors will need to be
    modeled in more detail.

    gen_store_to_release_ratio[STORAGE_GENS] describes the maximum rate
    that energy can be stored, expressed as a ratio of discharge power
    capacity. This is an optional parameter and will default to 1. If a
    storage project has 1 MW of dischage capacity and a gen_store_to_release_ratio
    of 1.2, then it can consume up to 1.2 MW of power while charging.

    gen_storage_energy_to_power_ratio[STORAGE_GENS], if specified, restricts
    the storage capacity (in MWh) to be a fixed multiple of the output
    power (in MW), i.e., specifies a particular number of hours of
    storage capacity. Omit this column or specify "." to allow Switch
    to choose the energy/power ratio. (Note: gen_storage_energy_overnight_cost
    or gen_overnight_cost should often be set to 0 when using this.)

    gen_storage_max_cycles_per_year[STORAGE_GENS], if specified, restricts
    the number of charge/discharge cycles each storage project can perform
    per year; one cycle is defined as discharging an amount of energy
    equal to the storage capacity of the project.

    gen_storage_energy_overnight_cost[(g, bld_yr) in
    STORAGE_GEN_BLD_YRS] is the overnight capital cost per MWh of
    energy capacity for building the given storage technology installed in the
    given investment period. This is only defined for storage technologies.
    Note that this describes the energy component and the overnight_cost
    describes the power component.

    build_gen_energy_predetermined[(g, bld_yr) in
    PREDETERMINED_GEN_BLD_YRS] is the amount of storage that has either been
    installed previously, or is slated for installation and is not a free
    decision variable. This is analogous to build_gen_predetermined, but in
    units of energy of storage capacity (MWh) rather than power (MW).

    BuildStorageEnergy[(g, bld_yr) in STORAGE_GEN_BLD_YRS]
    is a decision of how much energy capacity to build onto a storage
    project. This is analogous to BuildGen, but for energy rather than power.

    StorageEnergyInstallCosts[PERIODS] is an expression of the
    annual costs incurred by the BuildStorageEnergy decision.

    StorageEnergyCapacity[g, period] is an expression describing the
    cumulative available energy capacity of BuildStorageEnergy. This is
    analogous to GenCapacity.

    STORAGE_GEN_TPS is the subset of GEN_TPS,
    restricted to storage projects.

    ChargeStorage[(g, t) in STORAGE_GEN_TPS] is a dispatch
    decision of how much to charge a storage project in each timepoint.

    StorageNetCharge[LOAD_ZONE, TIMEPOINT] is an expression describing the
    aggregate impact of ChargeStorage in each load zone and timepoint.

    Charge_Storage_Upper_Limit[(g, t) in STORAGE_GEN_TPS]
    constrains ChargeStorage to available power capacity (accounting for
    gen_store_to_release_ratio)

    StateOfCharge[(g, t) in STORAGE_GEN_TPS] is a variable
    for tracking state of charge. This value stores the state of charge at
    the end of each timepoint for each storage project.

    Track_State_Of_Charge[(g, t) in STORAGE_GEN_TPS] constrains
    StateOfCharge based on the StateOfCharge in the previous timepoint,
    ChargeStorage and DispatchGen.

    State_Of_Charge_Upper_Limit[(g, t) in STORAGE_GEN_TPS]
    constrains StateOfCharge based on installed energy capacity.
