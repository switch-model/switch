    Augments a Pyomo abstract model object with sets and parameters to
    describe fuel markets. Unless otherwise stated, each set
    and parameter is mandatory. Unless otherwise specified, all dollar
    values are real dollars in BASE_YEAR.

    REGIONAL_FUEL_MARKETS is the set of all regional fuel markets. This
    may be may be abbreviated as rfm in parameter names and indexes, and
    may occasionally be referred to as a fuel region. In the current
    implementation, the names of each regional fuel market need to be
    distinct for each fuel type. That is, you cannot use "SouthWest" as
    a name for both natural gas and coal fuels. This is because market
    boundaries may be different for different fuel types due to physical
    infrastructure. This implementation detail could be revisited later
    if it proves cumbersome. An alternate implementation could specify
    each regional fuel market as a tuple pair of (region, fuel), but
    this might make indexing parameters in the code more verbose,
    confusing and error prone.

    rfm_fuel[rfm] defines the fuel sold in a regional fuel market.

    ZONE_FUELS is the set of fuels available in load zones. It is specified
    as set of 2-member tuples of (load_zone, fuel).

    zone_fuel_rfm[z, f] is the regional fuel market that supplies a a given load
    zone. Regional fuel markets may be referred to as fuel regions for
    brevity. A regional fuel market could be as small as a single load
    zone or as large as the entire study region. In general, each fuel
    type needs to separately specify its regional fuel market because
    most fuels have distinct transportation infrastructure, and
    bottlenecks in this infrastructure can form the physical divisions
    that define different regional markets.

    ZONE_RFMS is the set of all load-zone regional fuel market combinations.
    It is the input data from which zone_fuel_rfm[z,f] is derived.

    ZONES_IN_RFM[rfm] is an indexed set that lists the load zones
    within each regional fuel market.

    RFM_SUPPLY_TIERS is a set of 3-part tuples that stores:
    regional_fuel_market, period, supply_tier

    SUPPLY_TIERS_FOR_RFM_PERIOD[rfm, period] is an indexed set of supply tiers
    for a given regional fuel market and period. Supply tiers are an
    ordered set typically labeled 1 to n. Each tier of a supply curve
    have a cost and limit.

    rfm_supply_tier_cost[rfm, period, tier] is the cost of a fuel in a
    particular tier of a supply curve of a particular regional fuel
    market and investment period. The units are $ / MMBTU.

    rfm_supply_tier_limit[rfm, period, tier] is the annual limit of a
    fuel available at a particular cost in a supply curve of a
    particular regional fuel market and period. The default value of
    this parameter is infinity, indicating no limit. The units are MMBTU.

    ConsumeFuelTier[rfm, period, tier] is a decision variable that
    denotes the amount of fuel consumed in each tier of a supply curve
    in a particular regional fuel market and period (MMBtu/year). It
    has an upper bound of rfm_supply_tier_limit.

    FuelConsumptionInMarket[rfm, period] is a derived decision variable
    specifying the total amount of fuel consumed in a regional fuel
    market in a given period. In a dispatch module, a constraint should
    set this equal to the sum of all fuel consumed in that region. At
    some point in the future, I may convert this from a decision
    variable to an expression.

    Enforce_Fuel_Consumption_By_Tier[rfm, period] is a constraint that
    forces the total fuel consumption FuelConsumptionInMarket to be
    divided into distinct supply tiers.
        FuelConsumptionInMarket = sum(ConsumeFuelTier)

    zone_fuel_cost_adder[z, f, p] is an optional parameter that describes
    a localized flat cost adder for fuels. This could reflect local
    markup from a longer supply chain or more costly distribution
    infrastructure. The units are $ / MMBTU and the default value is 0.

    The total cost of of a given type of fuel is calculated as:
        sum(ConsumeFuelTier * rfm_supply_tier_cost) +
        sum(fuel_consumption_in_load_zone * zone_fuel_cost_adder)

    Each regional fuel market has a supply curve with discrete tiers
    of escalating costs. Tiered supply curves are flexible format that
    allows anything from a flat cost in every load zone with no limits
    on consumption, to a detailed supply curve of biomass for each load
    zone. To specify a simple flat cost, you would lump every load zone
    into a single regional fuel markets and specify a single-tier supply
    curve with no upper limit. To specify a detailed biomass supply
    curve, you would assign each load zone to a distinct biomass
    regional fuel market and specify multiple tiers in each market,
    where each tier has an upper bound.

    There is a simple data input format for situations where regional
    supply curves are unnecessary or undesired. This format specifies a
    flat cost for a load zones, fuel and period combination. The import
    code will expand this into a regional fuel market containing a
    single load zone with a single supply tier that has no upper bound.
    See load_inputs() function documentation below for more details.

    In Switch-WECC, biomass regional fuel markets are defined for each
    load area due to relatively high transportation costs, while natural
    gas regional fuel markets span the entire WECC region reflecting the
    interconnectedness of the pipelines. Prices can differ between load
    zones within the region based on different costs of infrastructure
    or number of middlemen in the supply chain, but all costs are based
    on an underlying commodity supply curve. Load-zone level price
    adjustments are specified with the zone_fuel_cost_adder parameter,
    based on fuel regions used by the National Energy Modeling System.

    For tiers of a supply curve with upper limits, the total volume on
    the supply curve is determined by aggregating annual consumption
    over all load zones in the regional fuel market. The model could be
    adjusted to aggregate consumption over other time scales, but
    currently only annual aggregation is implemented for supply curves.
    This version of Switch does not distinguish costs incurred by
    different fuel consumers within a regional fuel market.

    This version of Switch does not include producer surplus, so the
    aggregate cost paid for a given level of consumption does not
    reflect a market clearing price. Switch looks for societally and
    technically optimal solutions on the efficiency frontier that
    minimizes total costs, while trying to avoid embedding assumptions
    about market structure and dynamics. There are two primary
    motivations for this approach. First, many applications of Switch
    are for non-markets contexts of regulated utilities or state-owned
    utilities. Second, we don't currently know how electricity markets
    should be structured in high-renewable futures to incentivize
    investments that meet long-term societal goals and ensure cost-
    effective and reliable electricity. In the future it is quite
    possible that a large volume of energy consumption will be procured
    with favorable long-term contracts near cost rather than on a spot
    market that sets a clearing price equal to the largest accepted bid,
    which can awarding significant producer surplus. Alternatively, if
    consumers choose what infrastructure they want access to, they may
    seek long-term capacity contracts that incentivize investment and
    guarantee receipts for capital repayments and fixed costs. I don't
    know what the future of energy institutions or markets will hold,
    and I don't want to limit the technical possibilities with market
    structures from the past. One of our hopes is results from
    optimization models such as  Switch can inform future market and
    institutional restructuring to ensure that our societal goals are
    achieved cost-effectively.

    That being said, if a future researcher wished to include producer
    surplus to model a different perspective, that would be relatively
    straightforward to accomplish. The basic method is to order each
    segment of the supply curve by price, then going from low to high,
    increase the cost of each tier to reflect the producer surplus
    incurred from moving up from the next cheapest tier.

    Currently the model only supports supply curves with monotonically
    increasing costs. In theory it would be possible to support supply
    curves showing economies of scale with costs falling with higher
    volumes, but this is not currently supported. Implementing arbitrary
    supply curves would require introducing integer variables and
    potentially exposing non-linearities. Also, most scenarios generally
    show fuel consumption declining over time as the power sector is
    decarbonized, while the optimization becomes insensitive to the
    direct cost of carbon-based fuel because the emissions associated
    with the fuel are a much larger driver of consumption than the fuel
    costs.

    GENS_FOR_RFM_PERIOD[regional_fuel_market, period] is an indexed set
    of GENS that contribute to a given regional fuel market's activity
    in a given period.

    Enforce_Fuel_Consumption is a constraint that ties the aggregate
    fuel consumption from dispatch into FuelConsumptionInMarket variable
    from the fuel module.

    GEN_TP_FUELS_UNAVAILABLE is a subset of GEN_TP_FUELS for which fuel is
    unavailable.

    Enforce_Fuel_Unavailability[(g, t) in GEN_TP_FUELS_UNAVAILABLE] is a
    constraint that restricts GenFuelUseRate to 0 for in load zones and
    periods where the projects' fuel is unavailable.

    AverageFuelCosts[regional_fuel_market, period] is an expression that
    calculates the average cost paid for fuel in each market and period.
    This can be useful for post-optimization calculations of costs. Do
    not use this term in the optimization or else the problem will
    become non-linear.
