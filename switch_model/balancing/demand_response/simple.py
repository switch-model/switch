Defines a simple Demand Response Shift Service for the Switch model.
Load in a certain load zone may be shifted between timepoints belonging to the
same timeseries at no cost, which allows assessing the potential value of
demand shifting. This does not include a Shed Service (curtailment of load),
nor a Shimmy Service (fast dispatch for load following or regulation).

    Adds components to a Pyomo abstract model object to describe a demand
    response shift service.

    dr_shift_down_limit[(z,t in ZONE_TIMEPOINTS)] is a parameter
    that describes the maximum reduction in demand for load-shifting demand
    response (in MW) that is allowed in a load zone at a specific timepoint.
    Its default value is 0, and it may not exceed the load.

    dr_shift_up_limit[z,t] is a parameter that describes the maximum
    increase in demand for load-shifting demand response (in MW) that is
    allowed in a load zone at a specific timepoint. Its default value is
    infinity.

    ShiftDemand[z,t] is a decision variable describing how much load
    in MW is reduced (if its value is negative) or increased (if
    its value is positive). This variable is bounded by dr_shift_down_limit
    and dr_shift_up_limit.

    If the local_td module is included, ShiftDemand[z,t] will be registered
    with local_td's distributed node for energy balancing purposes. If
    local_td is not included, it will be registered with load zone's central
    node and will not reflect efficiency losses in the distribution network.

    DR_Shift_Net_Zero[z,ts in TIMESERIES] is a constraint that forces all the
    changes in the demand to balance out over the course of each timeseries.
