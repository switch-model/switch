cancel out the basic system load and replace it with a convex combination of bids

note: the demand_module (or some subsidiary module) may store calibration data
at the module level (not in the model), so this module should only be used with one
model at a time. An alternative approach would be to receive a calibration_data
object back from demand_module.calibrate(), then add that to the model and pass
it back to the bid function when needed.

note: we also take advantage of this assumption and store a reference to the
current demand_module in this module (rather than storing it in the model itself)

    # basis for optimality test:
    # 1. The total cost of supply, as a function of quantity produced each hour, forms
    # a surface which is convex downward, since it is linear (assuming all variables are
    # continuous or all integer variables are kept at their current level, i.e., the curve
    # is locally convex). (Think of the convex hull of the extreme points of the production
    # cost function.)
    # 2. The total benefit of consumption, as a function of quantity consumed each hour,
    # forms a surface which is concave downward (by the assumption/requirement of convexity
    # of the demand function).
    # 3. marginal costs (prev_marginal_cost) and production levels (pref_demand) from the
    # most recent solution to the master problem define a production cost plane which is
    # tangent to the production cost function at that production level. From 1, the production
    # cost function must lie on or above this surface everywhere. This plane is given by
    # (something + prev_marginal_cost * (demand - dr_bid))
    # 4. The last bid quantities (dr_bid) must be at a point where marginal benefit of consumption
    # equals marginal cost of consumption (prev_marginal_cost) in all directions; otherwise
    # they would not be a private optimum.
    # 5. The benefit reported in the last bid (dr_bid_benefit) shows the level of the total
    # benefit curve at that point.
    # 6. From 2, 4 and 5, the prev_marginal_cost and the last reported benefit must form
    # a plane which is at or above the total benefit curve everywhere. This plane is given by
    # (-DR_Welfare_Cost - (prev_marginal_cost * (demand - prev_demand) + something))
    # 7. Since the total cost curve must lie above the plane defined in 3. and the total
    # benefit curve must lie below the plane defined in 6., the (constant) distance between
    # these planes is an upper bound on the net benefit that can be obtained. This is given by
    # (-DR_Welfare_Cost - prev_marginal_cost * (demand - prev_demand))
