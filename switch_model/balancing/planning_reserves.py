This module defines planning reserves margins to support resource adequacy
requirements. These requirements are sometimes called capacity reserve margins.

Planning reserve margins have been an industry standard for decades that are
roughly defined as: (GenerationCapacity - Demand) / Demand. The idea was that
if you have 15% generation capacity above and beyond demand, the grid could
maintain high reliability. Generation capacity typically includes local
capacity and scheduled imports, while demand typically accounts for demand
response and other distributed energy resources.

This simple definition is problematic for energy-constrained resources such as
hydro, wind, solar, or storage. It also fails to account whether a resource
will be available when it is needed. As this problem became more recognized,
people shifted terminology from "planning reserve margin" to "resource
adequacy requirements" which had more dynamic rules based on time of day,
weather conditions, season, etc.

The "correct" treatment of energy constrained resources is still being debated.
This module implements a simple and flexible treatment, where the user can
specify capacity_value timeseries for any generator, so the available capacity
will be: GenCapacity[g] * capacity_value[g,t]. For renewable resources, this
capacity value timeseries will default to their capacity factor timeseries.

By default, storage and transmission will be credited with their expected
net power delivery.

includes both capacity and flexibility requirements. Capacity reserve
requirements can be both system-wide and local, and can potentially accomodate
anything that injects, withdraws or reshapes power. Note that the flexibility
requirements finally includes an energy component, not just ramping capabilities.

    PLANNING_RESERVE_REQUIREMENTS is the set of planning reserve requirements.
    Each planning reserve requirement specifies a certain capacity reserve
    margin be enforced over a certain geographic area in either peak load
    conditions or in every timepoint. Where specified, planning reserve
    requirements are enforced in every investment period. The planning reserve
    area is specified as set of load zones. Typical use cases include
    specifying one planning reserve requirement per load zone, one aggregate
    requirement for the entire system, or a combination of a system-wide
    requirement and requirements for transmission-constrained "load pockets".
    This set is abbreviated as PRR / prr.

    prr_reserve_margin[prr] is the capacity reserve margin for each PRR which
    defaults to 0.15

    prr_enforcement_timescale[prr] Determines whether planning reserve
    requirements are enforced in each timepoint, or just timepoints with peak
    load (zone_demand_mw). Allowed values are 'all_timepoints' and 'peak_load'.

    PRR_ZONES is a set of (prr, zone) that describes which zones contribute to a
    given planning reserve requirement. Zones may belong to more than one PRR.

    PRR_TIMEPOINTS is a sparse set of (prr, t)

    gen_capacity_value[g, t] is a ratio of how much of a generator's installed
    capacity should be credited towards capacity reserve requirements. This
    defaults to gen_max_capacity_factor for renewable projects with variable
    output and 1.0 for other plants.

    AvailableReserveCapacity[prr,t] summarizes the available generation
    capacity across each planning reserve area, taking into account
    capacity_value. If storage projects are being modeled, they are credited
    with their scheduled net deliveries (dispatch - charging). This is added
    to the CAPACITY_FOR_RESERVES list.

    If TXPowerNet is defined in the model, it will be added to the
    CAPACITY_FOR_RESERVES list.

    CapacityRequirements[z,t] is an expression that defines capacity reserve
    requirements. This is set to (1+prr_reserve_margin) * load
    If the local_td module has been included, load will be set to
    WithdrawFromCentralGrid, which accounts for Distributed Energy Resources
    reducing (or increasing) net load to the central grid.
    If the local_td module is not include, load is set to zone_demand_mw and
    will not reflect any DER activities.
