A simple and flexible model of spinning reserves that tracks the state of unit
commitment and dispatched capacity to ensures that the generation fleet has
enough up- and down- ramping capacity to satisfy reserve requirements. The
unit commitment module is a prerequisite for spinning reserves. This
formulation does not consider ramping speed or duration requirements, just MW
of upward and downward ramping capability.

Spinning reserve requirements can be customized through use of configuration
parameters and can include n-1 contingencies (either from generation units or
entire generation plants), as well as variability of load and variable
renewable resources. This lumps together regulating reserves, load following
reserves, and contingency reserves without distinguishing their timescales or
required response duration. Operating reserves at timescales with slower
responses for load following or longer-term recovery from contingencies are not
included here.

Most regions and countries use distinct terminology for reserves products and
distinct procedures for determining reserve requirements. This module provides
a simple approach to spinning reserve requirements, which can be extended by
other module via registering with dynamic lists. Detailed regional studies may
need to write their own reserve modules to reflect specific regional reserve
definitions and policies.

Notes:

This formulation only considers ramping capacity (MW), not duration or speed.
The lack of duration requirements could cause problems if a significant amount
of capacity is energy limited such as demand response, storage, or hydro.
California now has a duration requirement of 3 hours for some classes of
operating reserves. The lack of ramping speed could cause issues if the
generators that are earmarked for providing spinning reserves have significant
differences in ramping speeds that are important to account for. This
formulation could be extended in the future to break reserve products into
different categories based on overall response time (ramping speed &
telemetry), and specify different reserve requirements for various response
times: <1sec, <1 min, <5min, <15min, <1hr, 1day.

One standard (nonlinear) methodology for calculating reserve requirements
looks something like: k * sqrt(sigma_load^2 + sigma_renewable^2), where k is a
constant reflecting capacity requirements (typically in the range of 3-5), and
sigma's denote standard deviation in units of MW. Depending on the study,
sigma may be calculated on timescales of seconds to minutes. Several studies
estimate the sigmas with linear approximations. Some studies set
sigma_renewable as a function of renewable output, especially for wind where
power output shows the highest variability in the 40-60% output range because
that is the steepest section of its power production curve. This formulation
is not used here because the signma_renewable term would need to be
approximated using renewable power output, making this equation non-linear
with respect to dispatch decision variables.

Other studies have used linear equations for estimating reserve requirements:

The Western Wind and Solar Integration study suggested a heuristic of 3% *
load + 5% * renewable_output for spinning reserve capacity requirements, and
the same amount for quick start capacity requirements.

Halamay 2011 derives spinning reserve requirements of +2.1% / -2.8% of load
and ~ +2% / -3% for renewables to balance natural variability, and derives
non-spinning reserve requirements and +3.5% / -4.0% of load and ~ +/- 4% for
renewables to balance hour-ahead forecast errors.

Note: Most research appears to be headed towards dynamic and probabilistic
techniques, rather than the static approximations used here.

    MaximumContingency[(b,t) in BALANCING_AREA_TIMEPOINTS] is a variable that
    tracks the size of the largest contingency in each balancing area,
    accounting for every contingency that has been registered with
    Spinning_Reserve_Contingencies.

    BALANCING_AREA_TIMEPOINT_CONTINGENCIES is a set of (b, t, contingency) formed
    from the cross product of the set BALANCING_AREA_TIMEPOINTS and the dynamic
    list Spinning_Reserve_Contingencies.

    Enforce_MaximumContingency[(b,t,contingency) in BALANCING_AREA_TIMEPOINT_CONTINGENCIES]
    is a constraint that enforces the behavior of MaximumContingency by making
    MaximumContingency >= contingency for each contingency registered in the
    dynamic list Spinning_Reserve_Contingencies.

    Satisfy_Spinning_Reserve_Up_Requirement[(b,t) in BALANCING_AREA_TIMEPOINTS]
    is a constraint that ensures upward spinning reserve requirements are
    being satisfied based on the sums of the two dynamic lists
    Spinning_Reserve_Up_Provisions and Spinning_Reserve_Up_Requirements.
