        The `switch_model.hawaii.ev` module has a new flag
        `--report-vehicle-costs` that can be used to export info on the cost of
        electric and internal combustion engine vehicles to vehicle_costs.csv.
        You should use this flag instead of `--save-expressions
        ev_extra_annual_cost ice_annual_fuel_cost` if you want this information.
        This module also no longer assumes internal combustion engine vehicles
        use "Motor_Gasoline" as their fuel. Instead, it reads the name from the
        `ice_fuel` column in inputs/ev_fleet_info.csv. This should be set to
        "Motor_Gasoline" in your input files to continue the previous behavior.
        Also note: `ev_extra_cost_per_vehicle_year`, `ice_fuel` and
        `ice_miles_per_gallon` columns in ev.csv are now semi-optional. They
        must be provided if you use the `--report-vehicle-costs` flag but they
        can be omitted if you don't set this flag. When using this flag, 
        `ice_fuel` must match the name of a fuel in your `fuel_costs.csv` or
        `fuel_supply_curves.csv` input file.

        There are two important changes to the `demand_response.iterative`
        module in Switch 2.0.10: (1) The bidding function in the demand module
        must now accept duration_of_tp as an additional argument and must report
        the benefit of each bid (WTP) in dollars per hour instead of total
        dollars for the timeseries. Note that prices are given in $/MWh for each
        timepoint in the timeseries and quantities are reported back in MW for
        each timepoint (of indeterminate duration). WTP is typically calculated
        from p â€¢ q, which has units of $/hour * n_timepoints, which was the
        previous return value. Dividing this value by len(p) gives $/hour, which
        will be more robust across different timeseries definitions. (2) This
        module no longer defines its own unserved load components. Instead, you
        should use the `switch_model.balancing.unserved_load` module to ensure
        the model is feasible, even with large demand-side bids. Your modules
        list has been updated to reflect this change.
