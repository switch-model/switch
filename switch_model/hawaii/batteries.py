    # It's not clear how best to model battery cell replacement
    # One option: facility has a specific life, and variable O&M builds up a replacement fund for
    # intermediate cell replacement (but there's no extra salvage value from this?)?

    # Should battery facilities be priced per MW (power conversion) and per MWh (cells)?
    # Should we switch to modeling batteries with standard cost components -
    # capital, fixed O&M, variable O&M (which includes the cost of any early replacements)?
    # note: sodium sulfur is widely reported to have 15-year calendar life (due to corrosion at
    # high temperatures) and 4500 cycle life (which can be much longer with shallow cycles, much
    # shorter with deep cycles). So one cycle per day comes for "free" (i.e., is included in the
    # capital cost), but if there are two cycles per day, there should be a higher cost, included
    # in the variable O&M. This is tricky to model. If there were no limit on the calendar life,
    # we could omit the cell cost from fixed O&M and include it entirely in variable O&M. But then
    # it looks like you can get a high-capacity low-usage system for cheap (i.e., you ignore the
    # money tied up in the system while you wait to use it). So maybe my current approach is best:
    # only pay interest on the system (not full cost recovery), and pay into a fund every time you
    # use the battery, so on average you can always have a refurbished battery on hand.
