cancel out the basic system load and replace it with a convex combination of bids

note: the demand_module (or some subsidiary module) may store calibration data
at the module level (not in the model), so this module should only be used with one
model at a time. An alternative approach would be to receive a calibration_data
object back from demand_module.calibrate(), then add that to the model and pass
it back to the bid function when needed.

note: we also take advantage of this assumption and store a reference to the
current demand_module in this module (rather than storing it in the model itself)
