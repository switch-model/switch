# For large systems, each fuel market tier is a category of capacity expansion, and
# it can be built fractionally. For small systems, each fuel market tier is one
# capacity-expansion project, and it must be fully built and/or activated each period.
# To do this, we add binary variables and confine additions and activations to match them.
# Each tier has a capital cost and duration (locked in if it is developed)
# and a fixed and variable cost. Variable costs are already shown in fuel_markets.py,
# and this module adds fixed costs (some economies of scale, but assuming 100% salvage
# value at all times, i.e., projects can be deactivated without losing any capital cost.)
# Later we may add a more complete capital cost system.
