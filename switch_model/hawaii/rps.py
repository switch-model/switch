# which shows how much of the RPS will be allocated to each scenario.
# Problem: we multiply the RPS target by total generation, so this will become quadratic?
# May instead need to treat the RPS more like a limit on non-renewable production (as a fraction of loads)?
# Designate the allocations as a first-stage variable.
# Require each subproblem to work within its part of the allocation. Also require in each subproblem
# that the allocations across all weather scenarios (within each cost scenario) average out to match the
# actual target (when applying the scenario weights).
# Then PHA will force all the scenarios to agree on how the target is allocated among them.
# Could do the same with hydrogen storage: require average hydrogen stored across all scenarios
# to be less than the size of the storage built.
