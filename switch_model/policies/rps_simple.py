"""

This module defines a simple Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) policy scheme
for the Switch-Pyomo model. In this scheme, each fuel is categorized as RPS-
elegible or not. All non-fuel energy sources are assumed to be RPS-elegible.
Dispatched electricity that is generated by RPS-elegible sources in each
period is summed up and must meet an energy goal, set as a required percentage
of all energy that is generated in that period.

This module assumes that the generators.core.no_commit module is being used.
An error will be raised if this module is loaded along the
generators.core.commit package.

TODO:
Allow the usage of the commit module.

    f_rps_eligible[f in FUELS] is a binary parameter that flags each fuel as
    elegible for RPS accounting or not.
    
    RPS_ENERGY_SOURCES is a set enumerating all energy sources that contribute
    to RPS accounting. It is built by union of all fuels that are RPS elegible
    and the NON_FUEL_ENERGY_SOURCES set.
    
    RPS_PERIODS is a subset of PERIODS for which RPS goals are defined.
    
    rps_target[p in RPS_PERIODS] is the fraction of total generated energy in
    a period that has to be provided by RPS-elegible sources.
    
    RPSProjFuelPower[g, t in _FUEL_BASED_GEN_TPS] is an
    expression summarizing the power generated by RPS-elegible fuels in every
    fuel-based project. This cannot be simply taken to be equal to the
    dispatch level of the project, since a mix of RPS-elegible and unelegible
    fuels may be being consumed to produce that power. This expression is only
    valid when unit commitment is being ignored.
    
    RPSFuelEnergy[p] is an expression that sums all the energy produced using
    RPS-elegible fuels in fuel-based projects in a given period.
    
    RPSNonFuelEnergy[p] is an expression that sums all the energy produced
    using non-fuel sources in a given period.
    
    TotalGenerationInPeriod[p] is an expression that sums all the energy
    produced in a given period by all projects. This has to be calculated and
    cannot be taken to be equal to the total load in the period, because
    transmission losses could exist.
    
    RPS_Enforce_Target[p] is the constraint that forces energy produced by
    renewable sources to meet a fraction of the total energy produced in the
    period.
