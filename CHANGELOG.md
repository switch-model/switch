Switch 2.0.6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release fixes a bug where the fixed costs from all possible build years
were applied each period, instead of only using the build years that are still
in service in the current period. This increased the apparent cost of storage by
approximately (study length) / (storage life). This bug was introduced in 
version 2.0.0b3 and persisted through version 2.0.5, so results from earlier
models will need to be updated.

This will be the last version of Switch to work in Python 2. It requires at 
least Python 2.7.12 and also works with Python 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch 2.0.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release standardizes all inputs and outputs as .csv files.

As usual, when  you first solve an older model, Switch will prompt to backup and
upgrade the  inputs directory. If you accept, it will convert the existing
tab-delimited *.tab files and most ampl-format *.dat files to comma-delimited
*.csv files. It is recommended that you update your model data preparation
scripts to create .csv files directly. Note that non-indexed parameters should
now be stored in .csv files with a header row listing the parameter names and a
single data row showing their values.

All multi-value outputs from Switch are also now in comma-delimited .csv files,
instead of a mix of .csv, .tab and .txt files. (total_cost.txt is unchanged)

This release also includes includes the following minor updates:

- Updated installation instructions
- Switch version number and website are now shown in the startup banner when
  running with --verbose flag; solve messages have also been improved slightly
- Some parsing errors for *.tab files have been fixed in the upgrade scripts;
  this may cause errors during the upgrade process for input files that use
  spaces instead of tabs and were previously upgraded by Switch, producing
  malformed files.
- Fixed several bugs in the documentation and execution of the stochastic
  examples that use the PySP module of the Pyomo package

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch 2.0.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release introduces compatibility with Python 3. As of version 2.0.4, Switch
can now be run with either Python 2.7 or Python 3 (likely to work with 2.7.10+;
has been tested on 2.7.16 and 3.7.3).

This release will prompt to upgrade your model inputs directory, but the only
change it makes is to update switch_inputs_version.txt to 2.0.4.

This release includes the following updates:

- Code has been updated in many places to achieve Python 2/3
  cross-compatibility. Future contributors should ensure that their code is
  compatible with both Python 2 and 3 (e.g., use
  switch_model.utilities.iteritems(dict) instead of dict.iteritems(), be
  prepared for results from dict.keys(), dict.vars(), map(), range(), zip(),
  etc., to be either generators or lists, and use `from __future__ import
  division` whenever doing division).
- Installation instructions in INSTALL have been updated. We now recommend that
  users install dependencies using the conda command first, then install Switch
  using pip. This follows practices recommended in
  https://www.anaconda.com/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment/ and should minimize
  problems caused by incompatibilities between conda and pip.
- Output files (.csv, .tab, .tsv, and .txt) are now consistently written using
  the local system's line endings (LF on Mac or Linux, CRLF on Windows).
  Previously, most of these were written with only LF line endings on Windows.
- A bug was fixed in switch_model.transmission.local_td that prevented the
  carrying cost of Legacy local T&D capacity from being included in the
  objective function. As a result, users of this module will find that Switch
  now reports higher total costs than previously. However, this should not
  affect any of the decisions that Switch makes.
- To make switch_model.transmission.local_td module compatible with Python 3,
  "Legacy" was removed from the list of build years for local T&D capacity
  (Pyomo sorts index keys when solving the model, and Python 3 cannot sort lists
  that mix strings and numbers). Legacy capacity is now read directly from the
  existing_local_td[z] parameter when needed. This does not change the behavior
  of Switch, but "Legacy" rows are no longer written to the BuildLocalTD.tab
  output file. The LOCAL_TD_BLD_YRS set has also been removed. LOAD_ZONES *
  PERIODS can be used instead.
- A new indexed set, CURRENT_AND_PRIOR_PERIODS_FOR_PERIOD[p] has been added.
  This is useful for simple online capacity calculations for assets that cannot
  be retired during the study (e.g., AssetCapacity[p] = sum(BuildCapacity[v] for
  v in CURRENT_AND_PRIOR_PERIODS_FOR_PERIOD[p]))
- Code has been cleaned up a bit internally (e.g., removed trailing whitespace,
  changed "SWITCH" or "SWITCH-Pyomo" to "Switch")

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch 2.0.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Users can now provide data in variable_capacity_factors.tab and
  hydro_timeseries.tab for times before projects are built or after they are
  retired without raising an error. However, the extra datapoints will be
  ignored.
- Various parts of the code have better formatting, documentation and
  performance.
- switch_model.hawaii.smooth_dispatch is now compatible with Pyomo 5.6 and
  later.
- A new '--exact' option in switch_model.hawaii.rps forces the system to
  exactly meet the RPS target and no more. This is useful for studying the cost
  of adopting various levels of renewable power, including levels below the
  least-cost system design (i.e., cases where low shares of renewable power
  cause higher system costs).
- A bug was fixed when calculating the cost of water spillage in
  switch_model.generators.extensions.hydro_system.
- Final reservoir level in switch_model.generators.extensions.hydro_system
  is now stored in a varaible called ReservoirFinalVol. The ReservoirSurplus
  variable has been eliminated.
- Bounds on a number of inputs have been relaxed to allow unusual or edge cases.
  In particular, a number of variables can now be zero instead of strictly
  positive. This allows zero costs, zero capacity limits, zero-based year
  counting, etc.
- The  gen_is_baseload parameter is now optional, with a default value of False
  (0).
- NEW_TRANS_BLD_YRS has been renamed to TRANS_BLD_YRS.
- setup.py now lists an optional dependency on rpy2<3.9 instead of rpy2, because
  later versions of rpy2 require Python 3, which Switch doesn't support yet.
  This only affects the iterative demand response module.
- A new GENS_BY_ENERGY_SOURCE set can be used to identify all the generators
  that use any energy source, either a fuel or a non-fuel energy source.
  GENS_BY_FUEL and GENS_BY_NON_FUEL_ENERGY_SOURCE also still exist.
- We have begun migrating toward using `initialize` instead of `rule` when
  initializing Pyomo components, and recommend that users do the same in their
  custom modules. This matches the current Pyomo API documentation. `rule` also
  works for now, but `initialize` should be more future proof.
- The discrete-build requirement is now enforced on generators with
  predetermined build quantities, in addition to optimized generators.
- The optional psycopg2 dependency has been changed to psycopg2-binary.
- The --debug option now uses the ipdb debugger if available; otherwise it falls
  back to pdb.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch 2.0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- General
    - Added --assign-current-version argument to `switch upgrade`. This is
      useful for updating version number in example directories to match
      current version of Switch, even if the data files don't need an upgrade.

- Hawaii regional package
    - Fixed bug in hawaii.rps that would crash `switch solve --help`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch 2.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- General
    - Switch is now compatible with Pyomo 5.6+ (in addition to earlier
      versions).
    - A new --no-post-solve option prevents all post-solve actions (e.g., saving
      variable results).
    - If the user specifies --reload-prior-solution, Switch now behaves as if it
      had just solved the model, i.e., after loading the solution, it runs post-
      solve code unless --no-post-solve is specified (useful for re-running
      reporting code), and it only drops to an interactive Python prompt if the
      user also specifies --interact.
    - A new --no-save-solution disables automatic solution-saving. This saves
      time and disk space for models that won't need to be reloaded later.
    - New --quiet and --no-stream-solver arguments cancel --verbose and
      --stream-solver.
    - A new "--save-expression[s] <name1> <name2> ..." argument can be used to
      save values for any Pyomo Expression object to a .tab file after the model
      is solved (similar to the automatic saving of variable values). This also
      works for Param objects.
    - The --include-module(s), --exclude-module(s), --save-expression(s),
      --suffix(es) and --scenario(s) flags can now be used repeatedly on the
      command line, in options.txt or in scenarios.txt. The include and exclude
      options will be applied in the order they are encountered, in options.txt,
      then scenarios.txt, then the command line.
    - A new --retrieve-cplex-mip-duals flag can be used to support retrieving
      duals for a MIP program from the cplex solver (users must also turn on the
      "duals") suffix. This flag patches the Pyomo-generated cplex command
      script to pass the "change problem fix" command to the solver and then
      solve a second time. This fixes integer variables at their final values,
      then re-solves to obtain duals. This flag is not needed with the cplexamp
      solver.
    - A new balancing.demand_response.iterative module has been added. This was
      formerly in the Hawaii regional package. This module performs iterative
      solutions with any convex demand system, based on a bid-response process.
    - New indexed sets have been added to allow efficient selection of groups of
      generators that use a particular technology, fuel or non-fuel energy
      source: GENS_BY_TECHNOLOGY, GENS_BY_FUEL, GENS_BY_NON_FUEL_ENERGY_SOURCE.
    - Generator capacity data is saved to gen_cap.tab instead of gen_cap.txt and
      rows are sorted if user specifies --sorted-output.
    - Even if a model has solver warnings, results will be reported and
      post-solve will be performed if a valid solution is available.
    - A more descriptive warning is given when switch_model.reporting finds an
      uninitialized variable.
    - A warning is given about potential errors parsing arguments in the form
      "--flag=value". Python's argument parsing module can make mistakes with
      these, so "--flag value" is a safer choice.
    - Switch now monkeypatches Pyomo to accelerate reloading prior solutions.
      Previously Pyomo 5.1.1 (and maybe others) took longer to load prior
      solutions than solving the model.
    - At startup, "switch solve-scenarios" will restart jobs that were
      previously interrupted after being started by the same worker (same
      --job-id argument or SWITCH_JOB_ID environment variable). Note that
      workers automatically pull scenarios from the scenario list file until
      there are none left to solve, and avoid solving scenarios that have been
      pulled by other workers. Each worker should be given a unique job ID, and
      this ID should be reused if the worker is terminated and restarted. The
      new behavior ensures that jobs are not abandoned if a worker is restarted.

- Upgrade scripts
    - The upgrade scripts now report changes in module behavior or renamed
      modules while upgrading an inputs directory. This only reports changes to
      modules used in the current model.
    - The hawaii.reserves module is automatically replaced by
      balancing.operating_reserves.areas and
      balancing.operating_reserves.spinning_reserves in the module  list.
    - The hawaii.demand_response module is replaced by
      balancing.demand_response.iterative and hawaii.r_demand_system is replaced
      by balancing.demand_response.iterative.r_demand_system in the module list.
    - "switch_mod" will not be changed to "switch_modelel" if a module file is
      upgraded from 2.0.0b1 to 2.0.0b2 twice.

- Hawaii regional package
    - The hawaii.reserves module has been deprecated and the
      hawaii.demand_response module has been moved (see upgrade scripts)
    - Switch now places limits on down-reserves from pumped-storage hydro.
    - A new --rps-prefer-dist-pv option for hawaii.rps will prevent construction
      of new large PV until 90% of distributed PV potential has been developed.
    - Limits on load-shifting between hours in hawaii.demand_response_simple
      have been formalized.
    - The Hawaii storage energy cost calculation has been fixed.
    - Total production by energy source is reported by hawaii.save_results,
      ad-hoc technologies are added to production_by_technology.tsv, and
      hourly dispatch is disaggregated by non-fuel technologies.
    - Bugs have been fixed in reserve calculation for EVs and in
      hawaii.smooth_dispatch and hawaii.scenario_data.
    - hawaii.smooth_dispatch minimizes total inter-hour change instead of square
      of levels. The old quadratic smoothing method has been moved to
      hawaii.smooth_dispatch.quadratic (slow and possibly buggy).
    - The must-run requirement in hawaii.kalaeloa is turned off when RPS or EV
      share is above 75% (can be overridden by --run-kalaeloa-even-with-high-rps)
    - Support for nominal-dollar fuel price forecasts has been dropped from
      hawaii.scenario_data
    - A new --no-hydrogen flag can be used to deactivate the hydrogen module.
    - The hawaii.ev_advanced module now calculates vehicle fleet emissions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch 2.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First public release of Switch 2. This uses a similar framework to Switch 1,
but with numerous improvements. The most significant are:

- Written in Python instead of AMPL language
- Modular approach, so components can be easily added or removed from model
- Modeling of unit commitment and part load heat rates (optional)
- Generalization of sample timeseries to have arbitrary length instead of single
  days
- Standardized reporting, e.g., automatic export of all variable values
