ADVANCED INSTALLATION NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS AND ADVANCED USERS

If you are prone to work with more than one version of switch, you will
greatly benefit from python virtual environments which isolate your project's
python software from other versions that may be installed on the computer.
Software requirements and compatibilities change over time, sometimes in
incompatible ways. Virtual environments also help developers ensure they have
included all necessary dependencies in setup.py and aren't relying on
mannually installed system libraries. Using virtual environments to
encapsulate each project's customized software allows active and archived
projects to coexist on a single computer. These instructions assume you have
read INSTALL, have installed Anaconda (or equivalent), pip and solver
prerequisites.

INSTALLATION WITH PYTHON VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT

1. Open either a terminal or Anaconda command prompt (Start -> Anaconda ->
   Anaconda Prompt)

2a. DEVELOPERS
   Developers often work with switch example directories and don't necessarily
   have a separate folder with inputs for analysis. In this case, the source
   directory doubles as your project directory. Execute these commands, but
   set PROJECT_DIR to the actual path you want to use.
        PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/new/switch/checkout
        SRC_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR"

2b. ANALYSTS
   Analysts typically have a directory per project that stores data for their
   input scenarios as well as a copy of the code they are using. Execute these
   commands, but set PROJECT_DIR to the actual path you want to use. 
        PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/project/directory
        SRC_DIR="$PROJECT_DIR"/switch_source

   Note: If you are using one of Matthias's packaged scenarios with a
   submodule or subtree, set SRC_DIR to that subfolder instead of doing a
   fresh git checkout. In this case, skip step 3.

3. Download a copy of switch
        git clone https://github.com/switch-model/switch.git "$SRC_DIR"

4. Create a virtual environment in your project directory, and install switch
   and its prerequisites.
        cd "$PROJECT_DIR"
        pip install virtualenv
        virtualenv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install --editable "$SRC_DIR"

   Note: The --editable flag ensures that any changes to your downloaded copy
   of switch will be immediately reflected to your installed copy in the
   virtual environment.

5. Record the exact version of every library you are using so you can 
   precisely replicate this setup in the future. 
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
   Without this step, you are at higher risk of not being able to readily
   repeat or extend this analysis, especially if future releases of libraries
   are not completely backwards compatible (this has happened a few times in
   the past few years).


EXECUTION

1. Open either a terminal or Anaconda command prompt (Start -> Anaconda ->
   Anaconda Prompt) and navigate to your project directory.
2. Activate your virtual environment with the following command:
       source venv/bin/activate
3. Execute switch like normal
       switch solve ...
