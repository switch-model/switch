SYNOPSIS
	switch solve --verbose --log-run

This example illustrates the use of Switch to construct and run a very
simple model with a single load zone, one investment period, and two
timepoints.  This expands on copperplate0 by adding a few more types
of generators as well as local transmission and distribution.
