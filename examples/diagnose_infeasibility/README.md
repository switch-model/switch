SYNOPSIS
	switch solve --verbose --log-run --exclude-module switch_model.balancing.diagnose_infeasibility
	switch solve --verbose --log-run

This example is the same as "new_builds_only" but with caps on construction
that make the model infeasible. This is useful for experimenting with the
diagnose_infeasibility module (and this is used for testing that module).
