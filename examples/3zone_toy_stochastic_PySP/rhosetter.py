Implement a cost-proportional method of setting variable-specific rho values for
the progressive hedging  algorithm. Automatically retrieve cost parameters from
the active objective function.  See CP(*) strategy described in Watson, J. P., &
Woodruff, D. L. (2011). Progressive hedging innovations for a class of
stochastic mixed-integer resource allocation problems. Computational Management
Science.

Note, sympy is a pre-requisite. Install via `sudo pip install sympy`

Implementation notes: I couldn't find hooks in Pyomo to extract the cost
coefficient for each decision variable. The best I  could get was a text
representation of the objective expression, a formula which is not simplified
into an ultimate cost vector.  I use sympy to parse the text of the equation,
simplify it, and extract coefficients for each variable. The only problem is
that the variables are formatted  with indexes (ex. foo[2020,bar]) and sympy
can't parse those. So, I replace them with unique ids (ex. x123456) before
giving the formula to sympy, and reverse the process after sympy has finished
parsing.
