TODO:

data:
x tabulate heat rates for heco plants (fuel_use.tab created from Switch-Hawaii/data/Plant Heat Rates HECO/Appendix A Production Cost Database for Baseline system 2.xlsx)

extract existing plant details in suitable format for new switch - (edit "Switch-Hawaii/pyomo/data/get_scenario_data.py")

get QLPU ratings for existing plants

get minimum loads for new and existing plants

get heat rate curves for new plants

add code to create heat rate curve files for new and existing plants (when part load heat rates are in switch)

adapt switch to allow fuel costs by project and date
adapt switch to allow plants to use a power sales price (by hour) instead of a fuel cost.

- forced outage rates (use Paritosh's data for now, later compare to Table 3 of http://puc.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Adequacy-of-Supply-HECO-2015.pdf (2010-14))

find minimum commit (baseload status and maintenance schedules) for heco plants in past
http://puc.hawaii.gov/reports/energy-reports/adequacy-of-supply/
also mentioned in GE RPS roadmap study 2015

- find heco retirements and capacity additions (look through IRP and adequacy reports) (already in Paritosh's data from EIA)
http://puc.hawaii.gov/reports/energy-reports/adequacy-of-supply/
http://www.hawaiianelectric.com/heco/Clean-Energy/Integrated-Resource-Planning/Hawaiian-Electric-Company-IRP-Reports-and-PUC-Documents

get data on hourly power from as-available IPPs (????)

x find fuel cost data (ask Michael Roberts?)

- calculate capacity factors for existing wind farms (see "kahuku historical wind data sources.txt" and e-mails to Karl and Michael about historical RE data; put in as baseload 10 MW for now)

- find interruptible load data used for reserve planning in past (treat as zero for now)

code:
finance / discounting / weights / objective (or switch to Josiah's)
(above may be ignorable for historical HECO model)

create a launcher function that imports all the relevant modules (i.e., don't import the launcher)
   (or switch to Josiah's)

to switch to Josiah's code base:
- agree on indexing and expressions for project_build and project_dispatch
- add load zones
- maybe add balancing areas
- merge project_commitment
- merge project_fuel
- add commitment and dispatch slack variables to support reserves
