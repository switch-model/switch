This package defines the Switch model for Pyomo.

The core modules in this package are timescales, financials, load_zones,
energy_sources, tech, investment and operations.

An additional module is required to describe fuel costs - either
fuel_cost which specifies a simple flat fuel cost that can vary by load
zone and period, or fuel_markets which specifies a tiered supply curve.

Also, an additional module is required to constrain project dispatch -
either operations.no_commit or operations.unitcommit.

Most applications of Switch will also benefit from optional modules such as 
transmission, local_td, reserves, etc.
