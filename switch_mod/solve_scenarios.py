"""Scenario management module. 
Reads scenario-related arguments from the command line and the same options 
file that solve.py would read, and uses them to setup scenarios_to_run(). 
For each scenario, this generator yields a tokenized list of arguments that 
define that scenario (similar to sys.argv, but based on a line from a scenario 
definition file, followed by any options specified on the command line). 
Then it calls solve.main() with this list of arguments (once for each scenario).

A queueing system (based on lock directories within a queue directory) is used to
ensure that scenarios_to_run() will always return the next unsolved 
scenario from the scenario list file, even if the file is edited while this
script is running. This makes it possible to amend the scenario list while
long solver jobs are running. Multiple solver scripts can also use 
scenarios_to_run() in separate processes to select the next job to run.
