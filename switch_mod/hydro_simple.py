Defines a simple hydro electric model that ensures minimum and average
water dispatch levels that can vary by timepoint. Most people use this
as a starting point for working with hydro because it's simple, fairly
reasonable, and easy to work with. This supports dispatchable resevoir-
based hydro plants. This module is not needed to support run-of-river
plants; those may be specified as variable renewable plants with exogenous
energy availability.

A more full-featured hydro model is available from the Operations, Control
and Markets laboratory at Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile.
Where possible, I have used the same set and variable names to hopefully
make it easier to merge that into the codebase later. The Chilean branch
has a hydro model that includes water networks that connect dams via waterways
and ground infiltration. It should be possible to describe a simple system 
using the advanced framework, but the advanced framework would take longer to
read and understand. To really take advantage of it, you'll also need more
data than we usually have available.

After the Chilean model is merged into the main branch, I plan to refactor
this code to move the core components into a switch_mod.hydro.core module,
the simplisit components into switch_mod.hydro.simple, and the advanced
components into switch_mod.hydro.water_network. That should set a good example
for other people who want to do other custom handling of hydro.
