    Adds components to a Pyomo abstract model object to force discrete
    builds for generation technologies that have gen_unit_size specified.
    Unless otherwise stated, all power capacity is specified in units of
    MW and all sets and parameters are mandatory.

    NEW_DISCRETE_GEN_BLD_YRS is a subset of NEW_GEN_BLD_YRS that
    only includes projects that have gen_unit_size defined.

    BuildUnits[(g, bld_yr) in NEW_DISCRETE_GEN_BLD_YRS] is an
    integer decision variable of how many units to build.

    Build_Units_Consistency[(g, bld_yr) in NEW_DISCRETE_GEN_BLD_YRS]
    is a constraint that forces the continous decision variable
    BuildGen to be equal to BuildUnits * gen_unit_size.
