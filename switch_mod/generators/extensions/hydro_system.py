This module defines hydroelectric system components. It creates a hydraulic
system that works in parallel with the electric one. They are linked through
the power generation process at hydroelectric generators. The module builds
on top of generic generators, adding components linking power generation
with water use and availability. It requires the specification of the
water system topology, such as water nodes, reservoirs, water connections
and hydroelectric projects.

The hydraulic system is expected to be operational throughout the whole
time horizon of the simulation.

The water network is a graph composed of nodes and connections. Nodes
represent rivers, lakes or reservoirs, while connections represent flows
between nodes where generating stations may be located. All nodes can have
inflows and consumption that are independent of the hydrological network and
are specified with external data. All connections can control flow between
nodes, potentially limited by minimum flow constraints, or dictated by
geological filtration. All flow is currently downstream, but pumped hydro may
be implemented at a later date. Sink nodes have the ability to spill outside
of the hydraulic system. Reservoir nodes track their water levels during
investment periods, and have their levels externally determined at the
beginning and end of investment periods.

    WATER_NODES is the set of nodes of the water system that do not have
    storage capacity. These usually represent confluence and/or divergence
    of different water flows. Members of this set can be abbreviated as 
    wn or wnode.
    
    WNODE_TPS is a set showing all the combinations of
    water nodes and timepoints, in which the conservation of mass law 
    must be enforced. For now it is initialized as the cross product of
    the WATER_NODES and TIMEPOINTS sets, but it should be flexibilized 
    to allow for addition and removal of water nodes in intermediate
    timepoints of the simulation horizon.
    
    wnode_constant_inflow[wn] is the value of constant inflow of 
    water at each node of the hydraulic system throughout the whole 
    simulation. Inflow refers to an external source of water that comes 
    into the system at the water node, such as rainfall. Water flows
    that originate from an upstream model component, such as another water
    node or a reservoir, are decided by the model and so must not be
    specified here. This parameter is specified in cubic meters per second 
    (cumec) and defaults to 0.
    
    wnode_constant_consumption[wn] is the value of constant 
    consumption of water at each node of the hydraulic system throughout
    the whole simulation. Consumption refers to any activity that takes
    water out of the modeled hydraulic system, such as crop irrigation,
    human and animal consumption, minimum ecological flow for a sink
    node, etc. This parameter is specified in cubic meters per second 
    (cumec) and defaults to 0.
    
    wnode_tp_inflow[wn, t] and wnode_tp_consumption[wn, t]
    are the values of water inflow and consumption at each node of the
    hydraulic system specified at each timepoint. These are optional 
    parameters that default to wnode_constant_inflow_cumec and
    wnode_constant_consumption_cumec. Depending on data availability,
    these parameters may be used to represent different phenomena. In
    example, the Chilean datasets specify water inflows due to rainfall
    and melting snows at different nodes in a weekly basis. So, all
    simulated timepoints that belong to the same week will have the same
    wnode_tp_inflow_cumec parameter specified for each water node.
    
    wn_is_sink[WATER_NODES] is a binary flag indicating whether a water
    node is a sink. These nodes need not obey the law of conservation of 
    mass, so that water flows that go into them may be greater than the
    ones that flow out. The main use case for these is to be the end of a
    water basin (such as the ocean or a lake).
    
    node_spillage_cost is the parameter that sets the cost in $/(cubic meters)
    of spilling water out of the water network. This is equivalent to relaxing
    the conservation of mass law when balancing flows in each node and
    timepoint, so cost is set to a high default value. This parameter lets the
    model spill water freely in sink nodes, but relaxes the equality
    constraint for mass balance. This aids the solver in obtaining optimal
    solutions significantly faster and with small water spillages.
    
    SpillWaterAtNode[WNODE_TPS] are  the decisions of
    water spillage out of the water network at each node and timepoint
    in  cubic meters per second.
    
    
    RESERVOIRS is a subset of water nodes that are reservoirs. These
    require additional characterization. Members of this set may be
    abbreviated as r or res.
   
    res_min_vol[r] is a parameter that specifies the minimum storage
    capacity of the reservoir in millions of cubic meters. Usually
    this will be a positive value, since reservoirs cannot be
    completely emptied because of physical limitations, but it is
    allowed to be 0 in case relative volumes want to be used.
    
    res_max_vol[r] is a parameter that specifies the maximum storage
    capacity of the reservoir in millions of cubic meters. If at any

    timepoint the volume of water in the reservoir reaches this limit,
    spillage may occur to mantain the mass balance. This parameter is
    determined by the physical characteristics of the reservoir.
    
    RESERVOIR_TPS is a set showing all the combinations of
    reservoirs and timepoints, in which the conservation of mass law 
    must be enforced. For now it is initialized as the cross product of
    the RESERVOIRS and TIMEPOINTS sets, but it should be flexibilized 
    to allow for addition and removal of reservoirs in intermediate
    timepoints of the simulation horizon.
    
    res_min_vol_tp[r, t] and res_max_vol_tp[r, t] are the
    values of allowable minimum and maximum water volume at each 
    reservoir specified at each timepoint. These may be used to represent
    seasonal restrictions in water levels at any reservoir. In example,
    minimum volumes of water must be kept during summer at some reservoirs
    to allow for leisure and tourism activities, such as water sports.
    These parameters are optional and must be specified in cubic meters 
    and default to reservoir_min_vol and reservoir_max_vol.
    
    initial_res_vol[r] is a parameter that states the starting volume
    of stored water in each reservoir in millions of cubic meters. The
    same value will be used as a starting point in each period of the
    simulation, independent of which was the final level at the last
    timepoint of the previous period. This methodology has been used
    in several expansion planning papers  that include reservoir hydro
    power plants, because it allows decoupling the operational
    subproblems of each period and thus speeding up the optimization
    considerably.
    
    final_res_vol[r] is a parameter that states the final volume of
    stored water in each reservoir in millions of cubic meters. This
    level is enforced as a minimum for the final volume. Usually, this
    parameter is specified to be the same as  the initial volume, so
    that the reservoir may only arbitrage with the water inflows that
    come into it during the period.
    
    ReservoirVol[r, t] is a variable that tracks the volume of water
    at each reservoir in the beginging of each timepoint, specified in
    cubic meters. This variable is determined by the volume in the
    previous timepoint, the inflows and the outflows.
    
    ReservoirSurplus[r, p] is the amount of water in the reservoir at the end
    of each period in excess of final_res_vol[r].
    
    WATER_CONNECTIONS is the set of flows that begin and end in different
    water bodies, such as reservoirs and nodes. The model decides how much
    water is "dispatched" through each connection at each timepoint. Water
    may only flow in one direction, so "to" and "from" parameters must be
    inputted. Members of this set may be abbreviated by wc or wcon.
    
    WCON_TPS is the set of the cross product between 
    TIMEPOINTS and WATER_CONNECTIONS. In the future, this should be 
    flexibilized to allow for new water connections to be created within 
    the simulation horizon (as with WNODE_TPS and 
    RESERVOIR_TPS).
    
    water_node_from[wc] is a parameter that specifies the water body from
    which the connection extracts water.
    
    water_node_to[wc] is a parameter that specifies the water body to which 
    the connection injects water. 
    
    wc_capacity[wc] is a parameter that specifies the limit, in cubic
    meters per second, of the water flow through the connection. This
    datum is difficult to find, but could be relevant in some cases where
    rivers or streams have a defined capacity and greater flows could
    cause them to collapse and/or flood the surrounding area. Defaults
    to 9999 cumec.
    
    min_eco_flow[wc, t] is a parameter that indicates the minimum ecological 
    water flow that must be dispatched through each water connection at each 
    timepoint, specified in cubic meters per second. The parameter is
    indexed by timepoint to allow for representation of seasonal or hourly
    ecological or social constraints. This is an optional parameter that
    defaults to 0. 
    
    DispatchWater[wc, t] is a variable that represents how much water is
    flowing through each water connection at each timepoint. The lower bound is
    m.min_eco_flow[wc, t] and the upper bound is m.wc_capacity[wc].
    
    Enforce_Wnode_Balance[(wn, t) for (wn, t) in WNODE_TPS]
    is a constraint that enforces conservation of mass at water nodes. This
    accounts for any spills at sink nodes, or any change in reservoir volume
    between one timepoint and the next. This also links the reservoir volumes
    between timepoints, and enforces the final reservoir volume constraint.
    
    HYDRO_GENS is a subset of GENERATION_PROJECTS which are to be linked with the
    hydraulic system. Both reservoir generators as well as hydroelectric
    projects in series must be specified as HYDRO_GENS and will be
    treated the same. Members of this set may be abbreviated as hproj.
    
    HYDRO_GEN_TPS is a subset of GEN_TPS only with
    projects that belong to the HYDRO_GENS set. This set is used to
    index the electricity generation decisions.
    
    hydro_efficiency[hproj] is a parameter that specifies the hydraulic
    efficiency of a project, in units of MW/(cubic meters per second). 
    The amount of power generated by a hydroelectric generator with a 
    certain flow depends on the water head. This creates a non linear
    relationship between the generated power per water flow and the volume
    of stored water. In this module the efficiency is assumed to be a
    constant for each project, to keep the problem linead.
    
    hydraulic_location[hproj] is a parameter that specifies the water
    connection in which each hydro project is located. Multiple projects
    may be located at the same connection, which allows modeling of
    cascading generation.
    
    TurbinateFlow[hg, t] is a variable that represents the water flow, 
    in cubic meters per second, that is passed through the turbines of each 
    project at each timepoint. This is the flow that is used to generate
    electricity.
    
    SpillFlow[hg, t] is a variable that represents the water flow, 
    in cubic meters per second, that is spilled by each project at each
    timepoint. All spilled water is considered to be returned to the same
    water connection from which it was originally extracted. 
    
    Enforce_Hydro_Generation[hg, t] is the constraint that forces power
    generation at each hydro project to be equal to the flow of water that
    goes through its turbines, times its hydro efficiency. This relation
    is observed at each timepoint.
    
    Enforce_Hydro_Extraction[hg, t] is the constraint that mantains the
    conservation of mass at each project's water extraction point, so that
    the sum of the flows that go through its turbines and the one that is
    spilled are equal to the water that is flowing at each timepoint through
    the water connection where it is located.
    
    -----     
    TODO:    
    -Implement pumped storage     
    
    -Allow setting the water spillage cost as a parameter. The default
    of 10000 US$/cumecshould prevent significant water spillage in 
    non-sink nodes in mostcases. Nonetheless, some users could want to 
    lower the penalties forsome nodes in order to get faster solution 
    times, and other could want to raise them to avoid spilling completely.
