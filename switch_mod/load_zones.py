    Augments a Pyomo abstract model object with sets and parameters that
    describe load zones and some related geographic areas. Unless
    otherwise stated, each set and parameter is mandatory.

    LOAD_ZONES is the set of load zones. mod uses a zonal
    transport model to describe the power grid. Each zone is effectively
    modeled as a single bus connected to the inter-zonal transmission
    network, and connected to loads via local transmission and
    distribution that incurs efficiency losses and must be upgraded over
    time to always meet peak demand. Load zones are abbreviated as lz in
    parameter names and as z for indexes.

    lz_demand_mw[z,t] describes the average power demand in each load
    zone z and timepoint t. This is a non negative value.

    lz_dbid[z] stores an external database id for each load zone. This
    is optional and defaults to the name of the load zone. It will be
    printed out when results are exported.

    lz_cost_multipliers[z] is an zone-specific economic multiplier that
    modifies all costs incurred in each load zone. This could reflect
    differential costs of labor, regional inflation, etc. This is an
    optional parameter with a default of 1. mod-WECC uses values
    from the Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works Construction Cost Index
    System with values ranging from 0.92 to 1.20.

    lz_ccs_distance_km[z] describes the length of a pipeline in
    kilometers that would need to be built to transport CO2 from a load
    zones central bus to the nearest viable CCS reservoir. This
    parameter is optional and defaults to 0.

    DumpPower[load_zone, timepoint] is a decision variable that allows
    overproduction of energy in every load zone and timepoint.
    This may be interpretted either as the aggregate curtailment needed,
    or as a literal dump load. In the language of linear programming,
    this is a "slack variable" for an energy balancing constraint.

    LZ_Energy_Components_Produce and LZ_Energy_Components_Consume are
    lists of components that contribute to load-zone level energy
    balance equations. Other modules may add elements to either list.
    The energy_balance module will construct a Satisfy_Load constraint
    using these lists. Each component needs to be indexed by [load_zone,
    timepoint]. If this indexing is not convenient for native model
    components, I advise writing an Expression object indexed by [lz,t]
    that contains logic to access or summarize native model components.

    Derived parameters:

    lz_total_demand_in_period_mwh[z,p] describes the total energy demand
    of each load zone in each period in Megawatt hours.
