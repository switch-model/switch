# NOTE: instead of using the python csv writer, this directly writes tables to 
# file in the pyomo .tab format. This uses tabs between columns and the standard
# line break for the system it is run on. This does the following translations (only):
# - If a value contains double quotes, they get doubled.
# - If a value contains a single quote, tab or space character, the value gets enclosed in double quotes. 
#   (Note that pyomo doesn't allow quoting (and therefore spaces) in column headers.)
# - null values are converted to . (the pyomo/ampl standard for missing data)
# - any other values are simply passed to str().

# NOTE: this does not use the python csv writer because it doesn't support the quoting
# or null behaviors described above.


# NOTE: ANSI SQL specifies single quotes for literal strings, and postgres conforms
# to this, so all the queries below should use single quotes around strings.

# NOTE: write_table() will automatically convert null values to '.', 
# so pyomo will recognize them as missing data

# NOTE: the code below could be made more generic, e.g., a list of
# table names and queries, which are then processed at the end.
# But that would be harder to debug, and wouldn't allow for ad hoc 
# calculations or writing .dat files (which are used for a few parameters)
