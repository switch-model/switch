This contains the Switch electricity planning model written in Pyomo.
This optimization model is modular and can be used with varying levels
of complexity. Look in the examples directory for demonstrations of
using Switch for investment planning or production cost simulation. The
examples enable varying levels of model complexity by choosing which
modules to include.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

To generate documentation, go to the doc folder and run ./make_doc.sh.
This will build html documentation files from python doc strings which
will include descriptions of each module, their intentions, model
components they define, and what input files they expect.

TESTING
To test the entire codebase, run this command from the root directory:

./run_tests.py


EXAMPLES
To run an example, first update the python path to include the source directory.
If you downloaded the project to ~/src/switch, the commands are:
    cd ~/src/switch
    export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)":"$PYTHONPATH
    cd examples/copperplate0
    python -m switch_mod.solve --verbose
