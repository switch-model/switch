This contains the Switch electricity planning model written in Pyomo.
This optimization model is modular and can be used with varying levels
of complexity. Look in the examples directory for demonstrations of
using Switch for investment planning or production cost simulation. The
examples enable varying levels of model complexity by choosing which
modules to include.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

To generate documentation, go to the doc folder and run ./make_doc.sh
This will build html documenation files from python doc strings which
will includes descriptions of each module, their intentions, model
components they define, and what input files they expect. This
documentation is not well-formatted or pretty, but it will do until we
migrate to Sphinx and invest more effort into writing higher-level
documentation and tutorials. We don't include the documentation in the
git repository because pydoc creates links specific to the machine that
it is generated on. This means the generated documentation is not portable.

TESTING
To test the entire codebase, run this command from the root directory:

./run_tests.py


EXAMPLES
To run an example, first update the python path to include the source directory.
If you downloaded the project to ~/src/switch, the commands are:
    cd ~/src/switch
    export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)":"$PYTHONPATH
    cd examples/copperplate0
    python -m switch_mod.solve --verbose
