Software prerequisites for this project are:

Python v2.7
    We have not tested this on version 3, and do not have immediate plans
    to do so. We have verified our code works with v2.7.9 and 2.7.10. We
    had some difficulties with our testing framework on v2.7.3.

A solver such as GLPK, Cbc [https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc] or cplex.
    GLPK is an established open source solver that is easy to install 
    on most platforms. We have andecdotal reports that Cbc tends to
    be significantly faster, but have had difficulties installing it
    on some platforms. Cplex tends to be fast, but is proprietary and
    expensive for non-academics. It is free for registered academics who
    use it for teaching or research.

After installing prerequisites, you may install Switch by running the
following command from the switch directory:
	pip install --upgrade .

To install Switch in developer mode, run this command:
	pip install --editable .

To install "extras", optional modules that interfaces with R or psql, run these commands:
	sudo pip install --upgrade .[r]
	sudo pip install --upgrade .[psql]
